# Repository State

## What this repository is right now

`rbagents-shared-instruction` is a working dual-purpose MCP server and CLI at version `0.1.0`. It serves
the Roblox development set read-only. It is no longer a template: `PROMPT.md` and `template-mode.md` are
gone, and `src/tools/` holds one real tool.

## Stack

Node.js 20+, ESM, no build step. Two runtime dependencies:
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod`. Tests are `node --test`, no framework.

## What exists

* **The set.** `content/` holds 10 files, copied verbatim from the workspace
  set with their frontmatter intact, routed by an index under `content/index/`.
* **Tool layer.** `src/tools/` with one file per tool, each exporting `config` and
  `handler`. `src/server.js` imports them individually and registers each with
  `server.tool(name, description, schema?, handler)`; the old frozen `TOOLS` array is
  gone.
* **Traversal defence.** `src/content.js` rejects a `..` segment before any filesystem
  call, then confirms containment. The second check is redundant on purpose.
* **Read-only, structurally.** No tool accepts a verb, takes a credential, or opens a
  socket. The code that would write is absent rather than disabled.
* **Surface parity.** `src/cli.js` prints `listTools()` from `src/server.js`;
  `test/server.test.js` pins the CLI list against the MCP client's `tools/list`.
* **Instruction system.** Mode B - `AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/`, resolving the shared set
  through the `lxagents-agents-base` connector. Local rules: `repository`,
  `tool-authoring`, `secrets`. No overrides.
* **Documentation.** `wiki/information/` and `wiki/environments/`, all updated in the
  same commit as the code change they describe, plus the first changelog at
  `wiki/logs/0/1/0/`.
* **Container image.** `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`, running `src/index.js` with
  `MCP_TRANSPORT` selecting the transport. **Written and never built** — see
  [`../tasks/http-transport-container.md`](../tasks/http-transport-container.md).

## What is not built

* The HTTP transport is stateless and unauthenticated, and it is not a stateful
  server in front of a store. `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` narrows which `Host` header
  values are answered, and is **off when unset** — narrower than no check at all,
  and still not authentication.
* No CI workflow, no linter, no formatter.
* `content/` is a copy. A change to the set belongs upstream in the workspace set first;
  this repository is a delivery surface for it, not its editor.
* The version is still `0.1.0` from the template and has not been bumped - that needs
  the owner.

## Shared set

Resolved through the `lxagents-agents-base` MCP connector. Nothing shared is vendored
here, and there are no overrides - see
[`../../index/root-index.md`](../../index/root-index.md).

## Next obvious step

Add CI that runs `npm test` on push. The suite is the only thing holding the two surfaces
and the traversal defence together, and nothing runs it automatically.
