# Environment Variables

Two variables, both optional. The server starts with neither set and answers every
request.

| Variable | Default | Read by | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | `src/index.js` | `stdio` or `http` (`streamable-http` is accepted too). |
| `PORT` | `3000` | `src/index.js` | The port the HTTP transport listens on. Ignored on stdio. |

## There is no `API_KEY`

The template this repository was scaffolded from took one key for tools that reached an
external service. Nothing here reaches an external service, so there is no key, and no
tool reads a credential.

If a future tool needs one, the contract for that is
[`../../../.agents/rules/secrets.md`](../../../.agents/rules/secrets.md): check
`process.env` **inside the handler**, never at module scope, and never as a condition on
whether the tool is registered.

## `MCP_TRANSPORT` and `PORT`

```bash
# stdio (default)
npm start

# streamable HTTP on 3000
npm run start:http

# streamable HTTP on another port
MCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=8080 node src/index.js

# the same, through the CLI
rbagents-shared-instruction serve --http --port 8080
```

The CLI's `serve` command sets both variables from its flags, so `--http`, `--stdio`,
and `--port` are equivalent to exporting them.
